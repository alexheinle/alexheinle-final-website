#### Site Building Process
During the two month process of building my personal site, I faced many ups and downs. These challenges and solutions were eventually
the basis of my final creation.  I have used Netlify in a previous class, but this time I chose a new template.  I devoted the first couple
of weeks going through each file and learning about what it all does.  This basis helped me in the long run when I was able to easily find
code snippets that I planned on changing. I worked along side another peer who used the same template as me, so it made the editing process
a lot easier.  I found myself gliding through the work and finding many solutions to what I wanted finished. I eventaully came to a roadblock
in the process.  Without knowing, I must have accidentally deleted or changed specific files to make my html preview have an error.  I was
not able to see any changes and could not deploy my site without an issue occuring.  I compared notes to my peer, but eventually worked with
my professor to figure out the problem that was occuring.  After we found the solution, I was able to make changes and deploy my site and
finish it for the given due date.

#### Audiences
My personal site is built for the audience of future employeers who want to learn more about myself and my experience in CS. This website
is equivalent to a resume, but includes more details about me and my projects.  The overall form of my site includes everything on my website
plus more.  It goes deeper into my interests and my future plans as well. This content can cater to empoyeers interests by easily looking
at my experience and knowledge to see if I am fit for a job.

#### Design Decisions
My design decisions for my site was highly based off of previous assignments that we created in the class. The first assignment had to do with
a flow chart on how the site would be built. This helped tremendously because I was able to follow the chart to create the basic set up. We
had another assignment due where we wrote a developer narrative and that was easy to put in my 'About Me' page on my site. In the end,
the assignments we finished were helpful in creating our personal websites.
