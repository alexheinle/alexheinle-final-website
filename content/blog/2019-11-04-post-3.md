The computer science department at Allegheny College has given me many
opportunities to be involved with open source projects in order to help grow
my knowledge in the CS field.  I am proud to be apart of a team of
software engineers that work on a project called [GatorGrader] (https://www.gatorgrader.org).

GatorGrader is an automated grading tool that is used by professors in the
CS department to grade labs and practical assignments.  My teammates and I
are in the process of implementing new features along with making
the tool more efficient for users.

In the hyperlink above, it will lead you to the Github repository and
you can learn more about our open source project!
