This past summer, I interned at Vital Digital - a start up company located in
San Marcos, California.  [Vital Digital](https://vitaldigital.us/) connects websites with CRM systems to
support their digital marketing campaigns.

I was in charge of designing a prototype of an integration platform.  My goal was to create a new software component to replace Zapier, the main integration platform that Vital Digital uses during their daily work tasks. Zapier is a great integration tool but it only allows the user to choose from a limited list of API’s. Vital Digital would benefit more from a tool that would allow any API to be used without having to pay for an existing piece of software.
