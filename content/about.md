### Developer Narrative

Throughout the 20 years of my life, I have always been surrounded by new computer
technology, gaming systems, and high tech cameras. My father works in the computer
science industry and has always influenced my family to use the newest technology.
This concept was hard to grasp at the time, considering technology was not
prominent to the general population. I would attend the annual "Bring your
Child to Work Day" at his company which took me farther down the path of learning
about computer science and technology. In high school, I went with him to tech conferences and "Women in Technology" meetings where I learned about the importance of
women in the STEM field and talked to many empowering female engineers.  
Finally, I decided to take my first computer science class in high school.
Everyday, I looked forward to the class and took pride in every assignment
and loved every second of it! This is where everything came together and
where I realized I want to be a computer scientist.
